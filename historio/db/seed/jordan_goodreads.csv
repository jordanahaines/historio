36711317,"One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy",Carol  Anderson,"Anderson, Carol",Tonya Bolden,1635571375,9781635571370,3,4.4,Bloomsbury Publishing,Hardcover,288,2018,2018,,10/4/18,,,read,"The information in this book was great. It clearly lays bare the many (unfortunately successful) attempts at voter suppression against people of color and the poor. From voter ID laws to voter roll purges, the tools of voter suppression are well described and enumerated. I also appreciated the mention of specific court cases have degraded the right to vote over time.<br/><br/>I was not surprised to find that this book makes no attempt to be nonpartisan or neutral in its description of voter suppression. With that said, I found most of the language that was not factual to be primarily intended to magnify the malice of GOP suppression tactics. At many points this became distracting.<br/><br/>I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I read it further in the future or hadn't been as steeped in recent voter suppression stories. If you're familiar with the tactics of Kobach, Kemp, the NC Voter ID law, and states' voter purges then this book will serve as a refresher. If you're not familiar with these recent events, then you should read this book!",,,1,0

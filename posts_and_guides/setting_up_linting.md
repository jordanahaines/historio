# Setting Up Linting

1. `npm init @eslint/config`
2.

## Outstanding Issues

- Look into [scoped inting to use different configs for my two directories](https://github.com/vercel/style-guide/tree/canary?tab=readme-ov-file#scoped-configuration-with-overrides)
- eslintignore is being...ignored. How can I get that in use again or does it matter if I lint directories separately
